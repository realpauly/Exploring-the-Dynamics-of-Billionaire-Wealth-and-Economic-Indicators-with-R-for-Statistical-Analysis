# Introduction
This project investigates the relationship between billionaire wealth accumulation and various economic indicators such as GDP, tax revenue, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The analysis explores global patterns in wealth distribution and economic factors driving wealth disparities.

# Problem Statement
The primary objective is to analyze the factors that influence billionaire wealth accumulation and how these factors interact with broader economic indicators. The analysis will uncover sectoral, geographic, and demographic drivers behind wealth concentration.

# Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and transformation using R
Descriptive and inferential statistics
Correlation and regression analysis
Visualization of economic trends and wealth distribution
Assumptions testing and diagnostics for statistical models

# Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was cleaned and transformed using R. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, outliers, and preparing the data for statistical analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand data distribution and relationships between variables.

# Analysis
The project includes:
Descriptive Statistics and EDA: Summarizing billionaire demographics, industries, and regional wealth patterns.

# Conclusion and Recommendation
The analysis highlights key economic factors influencing billionaire wealth accumulation, with GDP and tax revenue showing notable associations. These insights can inform policy decisions around wealth inequality and economic policy. Further research should explore additional factors such as political influence and intergenerational wealth transfer.
